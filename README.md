This Flask web application lets users compare sports data of certain players in their respective sports to their other statistics in previous games throughout their career. 

The purpose: 
- Practice using Flask with a slightly more professional folder structure (app package with `__init__.py`, blueprints, and `run.py`)
- Use Jinja templates with a shared `base.html`
- Prepare one of the projects that will be linked from my portfolio site

I used ChatGPT to help with:

- Designing the folder structure (`app/`, `templates/`, `run.py`)
- Writing the starter code for `__init__.py` (the `create_app` function) and `routes.py` using a blueprint
- Writing the initial versions of `base.html`, `index.html`, `page1.html`, and `page2.html`
- Helping debug issues with the virtual environment, PowerShell execution policy, and import errors

code was generated by AI was reviewed and tested by me, and I made edits as needed.
