This Flask web application lets users compare sports data of certain players in their respective sports to their other statistics in previous games throughout their career. 

The purpose: 
- Practice using Flask with a slightly more professional folder structure (app package with `__init__.py`, blueprints, and `run.py`)
- Use Jinja templates with a shared `base.html`
- Prepare one of the projects that will be linked from my portfolio site

I used ChatGPT to help with:

- Designing the folder structure (`app/`, `templates/`, `run.py`)
- Writing the starter code for `__init__.py` (the `create_app` function) and `routes.py` using a blueprint
- Writing the initial versions of `base.html`, `index.html`, `page1.html`, and `page2.html`
- Helping debug issues with the virtual environment, PowerShell execution policy, and import errors

code was generated by AI was reviewed and tested by me, and I made edits as needed.

Anyone who wants to view or interact with the app must download the repository and run it on their own computer. To do this, the user simply clones the repository, creates and activates a Python virtual environment, installs the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt, and then starts the Flask development server using python run.py. Once the server is running, the application becomes accessible through a browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. This approach ensures the project can be viewed, tested, and evaluated exactly as it runs in a local Flask environment.
